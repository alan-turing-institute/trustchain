# Use Cases

Trustchain enables communities of any size to establish their own trustworthy public key infrastructure (PKI), without expensive setup costs or reliance on any third parties.

Since PKI is fundamental digital infrastructure, this opens the door to a wide variety of use cases. How you use Trustchain will depend on which of them you want to exploit. Here we describe four classes of use case that Trustchain supports.

## Verifiable Credentials

Trustchain enables a system of verifiable digital credentials that puts the user in control of their own data, providing the benefits of digital ID without the risks to privacy and data security.

This solution is based on the principle that credential-issuing institutions ought to be uniquely and transparently identifiable, while individual users need not be.

## Credentials for Data

Trustchain enables anybody to check the authenticity and provenance of data and digital media, by verifying its integrity and the identity of its original source.

Every news article, every image, every video could be signed by the original publisher, to prove it has not been modified or tampered with since its release.

## Verifiable URLs

There is currently no foolproof way to verify that a web page is legitimate before visiting it. This is a problem when URLs are displayed in QR codes at payment locations such as car parks or EV charging points, so-called QR code scams.

By making URLs cryptographically verifiable, Trustchain can provide robust defence against all types of phishing attacks, including QR code scams.
